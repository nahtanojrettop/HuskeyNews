<p class="JEP">I reporter JEP was at the scene when the first Stress Ball had exploded! After investigating I found that the victim
of the explosion had perhaps squeezed the ball too tightly. Was this person telling the truth? I decided yes. A few days after the explosion the 6th grade was working on they're China Dynasty timeline and project when a
second explosion occurred! It set back the 6th
graders at least an hour or two to clean up. Was this a sabotage? Was there no relation between the two
explosions? Officials were at the  sight in less than a minute with the supplies to clean the horrifying mess. Are the 6th Grade projects in danger?

<h3><u>Ninjas?</u></h3>
<p>13/Mar/2017<br>There have been rumors about ninjas going around Ascent.
I can tell you that there are no ninjas here... that I've found
yet. I'll keep you posted through these next several weeks. -JEP</p>
<p>20/Mar/2017<br>Hello again, it has been one week from my last entry and I have discoverd many new secrets about what I thought was just a simple rumor about a few ninjas running around Ascent. In fact I've disoverd that there are an intire clan of ninjas at Ascent! Through a resorse who would like to remain anonymous has told me that they even have an intire dojo too! Untill next time<br>-JEP</p>

<span class="SNF Talent-Show">
    <h2>Talent Show</h2>
    <p>As we all know the talent show is coming soon.<br> 
The original plan for the talent show was to put up three sign up sheets in strategic places with ordered colums and rows.
But that was not the students plan. The student councels plan was originally to have only a couple of students per grade sign up, but nearly all of the students 1st-5th signed up. The amount of people that signed up simply amazed me. It was complete chaos. Once the rows and colums filled. The students started creating their own rows and colums, until the  
paper was completely full. Then to add to the mess, they added their own sheets! with absolutely no colums or rows. Miss Louis(the 6th grade aid) said, "The papers all look like graffiti!"
and that is exactly what it looks like. Now some of the younger
grades are going to be forced to make a hard decision. They 
must cut most of the students to make room for the actual show I feel bad for the many students that will get cut, but if that is the way it has to be, than it will. I am lucky that I am in the 6th
grade because we only had a couple of people sign up, and I 
was not one of them. Hopefully the talent show will continue 
talented people.

    <h2>Ethan's Story</h2>
    <p>I am Ethan, I hold the school record for the most debt in lunch money. Exactly -175 dollars. That's like more money than I ever had in my life. I am also very popular, because every teacher knows my name. And all the kids, most likely because I am always getting in trouble and the teachers are always yelling out my name in front of the whole grade. I am Also really annoying well that's what the girls say, and girl are always right. I like doges, and I have one at home named Zoey. I play way too much video games. I like roblox and minecraft. I also like climbing stuff. I like getting on top of my house and just look at the view, but I only did that once. I have a lot of friends. Like Tyson, Shannon, Jaron, Tieghberius, Justin, Jared number 1, Jared number 2, nsilo,and Isaac. That's it for my life story.

    <p>Once upon a time, there was a news crew that would go to the ends of the earth for a good story. One day, they had to go to a haunted forest to prove that there was no ghosts. 
“I’m scared...let’s go!” Lily said in a shaky voice.
 “Are you scared?” Rose questioned.
“N-No! It’s just getting dark and it’s kind of cold.”<br>-TJF(Leader)<br>-HB(Author)<br>-LW(Grammer Correction)</p>

       <h2>Coding</h2>
       <p>Do you know what coding is?<br>Coding is a unique method used to design and <br>command all of the electronic you use in an ordinary and unordinary day.</P>
       <ul>
        <li>computers</li>
        <li>ovens</li>
        <li>tvs</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>All of the items that I listed above show examples of electronics<br>that you probably use daily. These are all run on code.<br>Coding is a really cool skill to have, but sometimes it can be hard to learn or understand. There are also many different languages in coding. It is probably not what your thinking. All coding in america is done in english. Each coding language has different rules, and are each set up differently. (keep in mind that the difficulty in each language of code also varies) Here is a list of some of the many coding languages.</p>
       <ul>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>Java</li>  
          <li>Java script</li>  
          <li>C#</li> 
          <li>Python</li> 
          <li>C++</li>  
          <li>PHP</li> 
          <li>IOS</li> 
          <li>Ruby/Rails</li>
          <li>HTML/CSS (which is the code that this website is made of)-basic website code</li>
          <li>etc.</li> 
       </ul>
       <p>As you can see ther are many codes. If you are intersted in coding and want to learn, here are some sites that I find useful for coding.</p>
